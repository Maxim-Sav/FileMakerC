# FileMakerC
A small program that follows my path in learning C. This program can create a python file and execute it on Mac, however can be changed to other language and other OS.

To change the code of the python program, change what is inside of PYCODE, just don't forget \n and \ before going to a new line.

To change the output of the program, change the file name and path in fopen(); by default this makes the file in the Users/{activeUser} directory.

I am not responsible for any misuse of this file maker.
